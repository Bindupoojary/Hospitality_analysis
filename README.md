🔍 Project Overview

AtliQ Grands is a luxury hotel chain operating across major Indian cities. Despite over 20 years in the hospitality industry, the group has been losing market share due to increasing competition, outdated decision-making processes, and limited utilization of their historical data.

To address this challenge, the Revenue Management Team commissioned a complete analytics dashboard to convert their raw data into actionable insights. The goal was to build a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution that enables data-driven decisions across departments.


This project focuses on:

Creating all required KPIs from raw fact tables

Designing a dashboard based on stakeholder mock-ups

Analyzing performance across cities, months, properties, and room categories

Generating insights to support revenue growth, occupancy improvement, and cost optimization

Tools Used: Excel, Power BI, Power Query, DAX
Data Sources:

fact_bookings – customer booking transactions

fact_aggregated_bookings – capacity, revenue, occupancy

dim_hotels, dim_rooms, dim_date – metadata

meta_data_hospitality – business descriptions
